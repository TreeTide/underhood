- frontend
  - TODO: server binary doesn't log / respond to invalid paths
  - TODO: automatically fold/summarize legal preamble and other stuff.

- Features TODO
  - Translation
    - callers in XRefReply
      - HTTP server doesn't provide them? They seem missing.

  - caching things

  - load test

  - FE IDE-on-par features
    - Document outline
    - Hierarchy panel based on sub/superclass info.
    - Mark super/subclass on gutter (can get from extends_overrides in decor req)
    - Top pane with info

  - FE xrefs
    - return ref language for xrefs
    - preprocess returned refs to  fit UI (group by file, etc)
    - xref paging
    - optional: show N lines around snippets

  - FE
    - jump to line if present in url

  - Full text search

  - Wish
    - magic keyword indexing (+camelCase, kebab-case..)
    - name indexing (loose name -> ticket lookup)

    - highlight ref density on filetree
    - xref counters on definitions (on-demand / auto).

    - Kythe: no callers recorded for 'go'? Callchain, xref site type doesn't work yet.
    - Write/Read locations, need support for "assignment" node in kythe.
    - Document overview mode - skip bodies, etc. Like outline but keep formatting,
      comments etc. Maybe even subfunction, variable names?

    - Decor: request target definitions, so direct jump is possible w/o xref query
      (premature opt)
